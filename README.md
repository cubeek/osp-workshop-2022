# osp-workshop-2022
This is a repository to obtain scenarios for the OSP Workshop 2022. The
description of what each scenario breaks can be found in SCENARIOS.txt file.
It's recommended to use virtualized environment because of use of libvirt
snapshots to restore the functionality. It's also possible to use real environment
but keep in mind scenarios break things and then it's up to you
to fix it because snapshotting won't work.
